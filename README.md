# UniCycle Architecture Builder
Universal Neural Interpretation and Cyclicity Engine (UNICYCLE)

Description coming soon, this stuff gets updated so often that I'll just write everything up when the MVP is rolling

-------

TO-DO

Things to do by next iteration of Unicycle:

v Pass around NetworkX instead of lists
	v Merge H into G
	v Merge nodes into NX
	v Merge node_out_size into NX
	v Merge node_state_size into NX
	v Merge node_harbors into NX
	v Merge node_input_touch into NX
	v Merge node_touch into NX
	v Copy for H

v Modify GenFuncCell to have methods to memoize outputs and states. Look into pruning.

- Look into Harbor generalization, merge Harbor_Dummy into Harbor

v flake8 things

- Add tests!

- Do training ooooh yeah - timing test and regression test. Benchmarks
